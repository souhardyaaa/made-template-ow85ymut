# Project Plan

## Title

### Impact of Sectoral Energy Consumption on GHG Emissions and Lung Disease Mortality in Germany

## Main Questions


1. Analyse the correlation between greenhouse emissions and total energy consumption in Germany
2. Determine the impact of individual sectors on greenhouse emissions in Germany.
3. Identify trends in greenhouse emissions in relation to increases or decreases in deaths by pneumonia in Germany.


## Description


In this data engineering project, we analyse the relationship between energy consumption, greenhouse emissions, and lung diseases such as pneumonia in Germany from 2011-2021. The goal is to understand sector-wise contributions to greenhouse emissions and identify trends for future predictions. 


## Datasources


### Data Source 1: Final Energy Consumption by Sector

Source: Eurostat API
